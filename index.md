m64p uses [mupen64plus-gui](https://github.com/m64p/mupen64plus-gui), a brand new mupen64plus frontend written in Qt5. It supports all of the things you'd expect from a frontend (savestate management, pausing, screenshots, etc.).

m64p comes bundled with [GLideN64](https://github.com/gonetz/GLideN64) for the graphics plugin. It should give you the best out-of-the-box experience available for N64 gaming.

### Compatibility ###

This is likely the most compatible N64 emulator you're going to come across. It can play games like Resident Evil 2, Rogue Squadron, Pokemon Snap, and World Driver Championship "out-of-the-box" (without the need to fiddle with settings, plugins, or anything of the sort).

Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. There is no installer, just unzip and play!
