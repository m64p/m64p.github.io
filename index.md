## Welcome to m64p (mupen64plus + GLideN64 + a GUI)

The links to download binary builds for Windows and Linux are in the sidebar.

m64p uses [mupen64plus-gui](https://github.com/m64p/mupen64plus-gui), a brand new mupen64plus frontend written in Qt5. It supports all of the things you'd expect from a frontend (savestate management, pausing, screenshots, etc.).

m64p comes bundled with [GLideN64](https://github.com/gonetz/GLideN64) for the graphics plugin. It should give you the best out-of-the-box experience available for N64 gaming.

### Starting with a fresh config ###

If you've ever used any version of mupen64plus before, you might have a configuration file saved on your computer. I suggest starting with a fresh config if this is your first time here. Go to ***Settings->Core and Plugin Settings***. At the bottom click on ***Reset All Settings***.

### Compatibility ###

This is likely the most compatible N64 emulator you're going to come across. It can play games like Resident Evil 2, Rogue Squadron, Pokemon Snap, and World Driver Championship "out-of-the-box" (without the need to fiddle with settings, plugins, or anything of the sort).

Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. There is no installer, just unzip and play!

If you run into any issues, I would love to hear about it [here](https://github.com/m64p/mupen64plus-GLideN64/issues).

### Patreon ###

Download links are available to Patreon subscribers via the posts on [this page](https://www.patreon.com/m64p/posts). I will work my best to keep m64p updated with the latest developments from mupen64plus and GLideN64, I will also work on improving the GUI and making emulation accuracy improvements.
