m64p uses [mupen64plus-gui](https://github.com/m64p/mupen64plus-gui), a brand new mupen64plus frontend written in Qt5. It supports all of the things you'd expect from a frontend (savestate management, pausing, screenshots, etc.).

m64p comes bundled with [paraLLEl-RDP](https://github.com/Themaister/parallel-rdp) for graphics. It should give you the best out-of-the-box experience available for N64 gaming.
### System Requirements ###

m64p has higher system requirements than most N64 emulators. Your GPU needs to support Vulkan 1.1, and you need a fairly good CPU to run the games at full speed. If nothing happens when you go to start a game, it is likely because your GPU doesn't support Vulkan 1.1.

### Compatibility ###

This is likely the most compatible N64 emulator you're going to come across. It can play games like Resident Evil 2, Rogue Squadron, Pokemon Snap, and World Driver Championship "out-of-the-box" (without the need to fiddle with settings, plugins, or anything of the sort).

Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. There is no installer, just unzip and play!
